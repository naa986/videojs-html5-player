=== How to Use Video.js HTML5 Player ===

In order to embed a video create a new post/page and use the following shortcode:

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4"]`

Here, "url" is the location of the MP4 video source file (H.264 encoded). You need to replace the sample URL with the actual URL of the video file.

= Video Shortcode Options =

The following options are supported in the shortcode.

**WebM**

You can specify a WebM video file in addition to the source MP4 video file. This parameter is optional.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" webm="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.webm"]`

**Ogv**

You can specify a Ogv video file in addition to the source MP4 & WebM video files. This parameter is optional.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" webm="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.webm" ogv="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.ogv"]`

**Width**

Defines the width of the video file (Height is automatically calculated). This option is not required unless you want to limit the maximum width of the video.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" width="480"]`

**Preload**

Specifies if and how the video should be loaded when the page loads. Defaults to "auto" (the video should be loaded entirely when the page loads). Other options:

* "metadata" - only metadata should be loaded when the page loads
* "none" - the video should not be loaded when the page loads

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" preload="metadata"]`

**Controls**

Specifies that video controls should be displayed. Defaults to "true". In order to hide controls set this parameter to "false".

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" controls="false"]`

When you disable controls users will not be able to interact with your videos. So It is recommended that you enable autoplay for a video with no controls.

**Autoplay**

Causes the video file to automatically play when the page loads.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" autoplay="true"]`

**Poster**

Defines image to show as placeholder before the video plays.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" poster="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/poster.jpg"]`

**Loop**

Causes the video file to loop to beginning when finished and automatically continue playing.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" loop="true"]`

**Muted**

Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted.

`[videojs_video url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/videos/myvid.mp4" muted="true"]`
